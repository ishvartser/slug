CMPS101: Algorithms & Abstract Data Types
Program 4: Google Directions
Professor D. Helmbold
UC Santa Cruz

The program reads in data and uses a graph abstract data type to
mimic a Google-Maps-type feature in which we're able to find the
distance from one point to another using breadth-first-search.

Files:

	***** main.c *****
	This file is responsible for scanning data from a specified file,
	creating a graph, and implementing a breadth first search.

	***** graph.c *****
	This file is responsible for creating a graph structure, 
	and implementing all relevant functions (breadth first search,
	cleaning the graph, freeing memory on the graph, adding edges,
	and finding distances). 

	***** graph.h *****
	Outline of functions used in graph.c

	***** graphDriver.c *****
	This file is responsible for testing the graph abstract data 
	type implemented in graph.c

	***** list.c *****
	This file is responsible for implementing a linked list
	and all of the necessary manipulator/access functions.

	***** list.h *****
	Outline of functions used in list.c

	***** listDriver.c *****
	This file is responsible for testing the list abstract data
	type implemented in list.c

	***** Makefile *****
	Compiles all relevant files.

	***** README *****
	The file outlining the functions of each piece of the assignment.
