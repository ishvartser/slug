In this assignment we write a program in Java to implement a client/server 
chatter application. We will be making use of internet connections 
using sockets. Each process will consist of several threads.

To specify a server:
    chatter [-@ ﬂags] port

To specify a client:
    chatter [-@ ﬂags] hostname:port username
